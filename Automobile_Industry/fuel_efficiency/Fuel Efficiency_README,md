# Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the fuel efficiency of vehicles (MPG) and identifies key factors influencing it, such as engine size, weight, and horsepower. It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and regression modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Results
- RMSE: 3.5
- RÂ² Score: 0.82
- Key Insights: Weight and horsepower have the most significant impact on fuel efficiency.
